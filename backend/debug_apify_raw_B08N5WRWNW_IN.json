          "reviewDescription": "As an avid Apple fan, I was really excited to get this M1 MacBook Pro as my first ever Mac. And going a few weeks using it, it definitely lives up to its reputation! I have the 512gb SSD 8gb RAM configuration.Battery: It sips battery life and I can easily last a day of extensive graphic designing and editing and a few hours worth of calls and still have a little below 50% left!Ecosystem: I already had an iPhone and an iPad and getting another Apple device just adds into the ecosystem. I can receive calls, transfer documents and carry over my work from one device to another!Performance: This MBP boasts power. Most apps open instantly from Chrome to Adobe Premiere Pro and it handles tasks like a beast! It has a gorgeous display perfect for color accurate work and has loud, extremely good speakers. Attending calls and multitasking is super intuitive and with macOS Big Sur the whole system is snappy. It’s so good, that I almost never shut it down, it instantly wakes up from sleep and I’m ready to get going!Really there are only some minor inconveniences here: There are only two Thunderbolt ports and a headphone jack. That is a limitation at times.It’s a bit heavy at 1.4kg but if most of your work is mostly desk orientated, then it shouldn’t be a problem.Another “issue” is the app compatibility thing with M1. Since these Macs are now ARM based and not x64 like their Intel counterparts, you may run into some silly stuff occasionally. But that’s part of the process. I’d suggest you check in advance if your favorite and essential apps are working with these Silicon macs.Overall, anyone looking to upgrade their experience to a whole new level, look no further!I have been loving this machine so much that I doubt that I’m ever returning back to Windows!",

          "reviewDescription": "I bought a 512 GB / 8 GB MAC model (Space Grey) Macbook Pro M1. Great product, faster than many MAC models. Front camera though looks blurry in medium/low light and that is a total disappointment when you are spending a huge amount on Apple devices. It is so blurry even your 2013 Mac model would look better in front of it. Battery life though is really good and Apple's tall claims of 20 hours of battery life are pretty much good. The only problem is they are using a simulator Rosetta for lot of applications which may or may not be simulating it perfectly. I haven't found a problem as of now but read a lot of reviews on YouTube. Not tested the gaming environment for now, so no comments on that. I would recommend to wait for some new MAC model with improvements to the M1 chip.Also, I recently bought this and I'm pretty new to exploring the MAC environment myself, Amazon did put a price drop on this within a week and now they do not agree to match the price. Really sad when you buy products like these and the price drop and they are not ready to match it, instead they suggest to place another order and return the existing order which I think is downright insane.Overall product is fine though, if not for Amazon sucky price match policy. Disappointed with Amazon though on this part.",

Butter smooth editing experience even in best quality mode.Only render time suffers during exporting HDR 4k video file.If you are exporting no HDR file then rendering and exporting is hyper fast.So M1 chip is really making everything seems so fluid and fast.Comparison with other laptops:This laptop has spoiled me.I tried to go back to windows for a work but made me realise as if i am using some old machine from past. ( windows laptop that i was using was also launched this year with latest specifications)Final conclusion:If you do lots of editingGo for Pro model if your budget allowsDont stretch your budget if you can afford macbook air M1Only if you need consistent high performance for prolonged period then buy this pro model else go with macbook air modelBoth are equally powerful.Cons:Less portsThats it.",

          "reviewDescription": "As an avid Apple fan, I was really excited to get this M1 MacBook Pro as my first ever Mac. And going a few weeks using it, it definitely lives up to its reputation! I have the 512gb SSD 8gb RAM configuration.Battery: It sips battery life and I can easily last a day of extensive graphic designing and editing and a few hours worth of calls and still have a little below 50% left!Ecosystem: I already had an iPhone and an iPad and getting another Apple device just adds into the ecosystem. I can receive calls, transfer documents and carry over my work from one device to another!Performance: This MBP boasts power. Most apps open instantly from Chrome to Adobe Premiere Pro and it handles tasks like a beast! It has a gorgeous display perfect for color accurate work and has loud, extremely good speakers. Attending calls and multitasking is super intuitive and with macOS Big Sur the whole system is snappy. It’s so good, that I almost never shut it down, it instantly wakes up from sleep and I’m ready to get going!Really there are only some minor inconveniences here: There are only two Thunderbolt ports and a headphone jack. That is a limitation at times.It’s a bit heavy at 1.4kg but if most of your work is mostly desk orientated, then it shouldn’t be a problem.Another “issue” is the app compatibility thing with M1. Since these Macs are now ARM based and not x64 like their Intel counterparts, you may run into some silly stuff occasionally. But that’s part of the process. I’d suggest you check in advance if your favorite and essential apps are working with these Silicon macs.Overall, anyone looking to upgrade their experience to a whole new level, look no further!I have been loving this machine so much that I doubt that I’m ever returning back to Windows!",

Superior performance in terms of Graphics rendering, app opening and system turn on and most importantly Out of the world battery life. The thermal performance is way better than the intel chips based MacBook pros , despite playing Graphics intensive games (Asphalt 9) while copying files from an external hard drive , still didn’t trigger the fans to go high speed … so far a great experience. Only wish it came in 16\" screen size",

          "reviewDescription": "I bought a 512 GB / 8 GB MAC model (Space Grey) Macbook Pro M1. Great product, faster than many MAC models. Front camera though looks blurry in medium/low light and that is a total disappointment when you are spending a huge amount on Apple devices. It is so blurry even your 2013 Mac model would look better in front of it. Battery life though is really good and Apple's tall claims of 20 hours of battery life are pretty much good. The only problem is they are using a simulator Rosetta for lot of applications which may or may not be simulating it perfectly. I haven't found a problem as of now but read a lot of reviews on YouTube. Not tested the gaming environment for now, so no comments on that. I would recommend to wait for some new MAC model with improvements to the M1 chip.Also, I recently bought this and I'm pretty new to exploring the MAC environment myself, Amazon did put a price drop on this within a week and now they do not agree to match the price. Really sad when you buy products like these and the price drop and they are not ready to match it, instead they suggest to place another order and return the existing order which I think is downright insane.Overall product is fine though, if not for Amazon sucky price match policy. Disappointed with Amazon though on this part.",

Its a very powerful and light machineRam management:Just perfect. 8gb is sufficient. I am able to open around 60 to 90 tabs in safari plus final cut pro plus Microsoft word, excel and using side car with ipad all at once and not even a single lag or drop its butter smooth.Performance in editing:Editing 8k videos HDR content in final cut pro. Butter smooth editing experience even in best quality mode.Only render time suffers during exporting HDR 4k video file.If you are exporting no HDR file then rendering and exporting is hyper fast.So M1 chip is really making everything seems so fluid and fast.Comparison with other laptops:This laptop has spoiled me.I tried to go back to windows for a work but made me realise as if i am using some old machine from past. ( windows laptop that i was using was also launched this year with latest specifications)Final conclusion:If you do lots of editingGo for Pro model if your budget allowsDont stretch your budget if you can afford macbook air M1Only if you need consistent high performance for prolonged period then buy this pro model else go with macbook air modelBoth are equally powerful.Cons:Less portsThats it.",

          "reviewDescription": "As an avid Apple fan, I was really excited to get this M1 MacBook Pro as my first ever Mac. And going a few weeks using it, it definitely lives up to its reputation! I have the 512gb SSD 8gb RAM configuration.Battery: It sips battery life and I can easily last a day of extensive graphic designing and editing and a few hours worth of calls and still have a little below 50% left!Ecosystem: I already had an iPhone and an iPad and getting another Apple device just adds into the ecosystem. I can receive calls, transfer documents and carry over my work from one device to another!Performance: This MBP boasts power. Most apps open instantly from Chrome to Adobe Premiere Pro and it handles tasks like a beast! It has a gorgeous display perfect for color accurate work and has loud, extremely good speakers. Attending calls and multitasking is super intuitive and with macOS Big Sur the whole system is snappy. It’s so good, that I almost never shut it down, it instantly wakes up from sleep and I’m ready to get going!Really there are only some minor inconveniences here: There are only two Thunderbolt ports and a headphone jack. That is a limitation at times.It’s a bit heavy at 1.4kg but if most of your work is mostly desk orientated, then it shouldn’t be a problem.Another “issue” is the app compatibility thing with M1. Since these Macs are now ARM based and not x64 like their Intel counterparts, you may run into some silly stuff occasionally. But that’s part of the process. I’d suggest you check in advance if your favorite and essential apps are working with these Silicon macs.Overall, anyone looking to upgrade their experience to a whole new level, look no further!I have been loving this machine so much that I doubt that I’m ever returning back to Windows!",

          "reviewDescription": "I bought a 512 GB / 8 GB MAC model (Space Grey) Macbook Pro M1. Great product, faster than many MAC models. Front camera though looks blurry in medium/low light and that is a total disappointment when you are spending a huge amount on Apple devices. It is so blurry even your 2013 Mac model would look better in front of it. Battery life though is really good and Apple's tall claims of 20 hours of battery life are pretty much good. The only problem is they are using a simulator Rosetta for lot of applications which may or may not be simulating it perfectly. I haven't found a problem as of now but read a lot of reviews on YouTube. Not tested the gaming environment for now, so no comments on that. I would recommend to wait for some new MAC model with improvements to the M1 chip.Also, I recently bought this and I'm pretty new to exploring the MAC environment myself, Amazon did put a price drop on this within a week and now they do not agree to match the price. Really sad when you buy products like these and the price drop and they are not ready to match it, instead they suggest to place another order and return the existing order which I think is downright insane.Overall product is fine though, if not for Amazon sucky price match policy. Disappointed with Amazon though on this part.",

          "reviewDescription": "As an avid Apple fan, I was really excited to get this M1 MacBook Pro as my first ever Mac. And going a few weeks using it, it definitely lives up to its reputation! I have the 512gb SSD 8gb RAM configuration.Battery: It sips battery life and I can easily last a day of extensive graphic designing and editing and a few hours worth of calls and still have a little below 50% left!Ecosystem: I already had an iPhone and an iPad and getting another Apple device just adds into the ecosystem. I can receive calls, transfer documents and carry over my work from one device to another!Performance: This MBP boasts power. Most apps open instantly from Chrome to Adobe Premiere Pro and it handles tasks like a beast! It has a gorgeous display perfect for color accurate work and has loud, extremely good speakers. Attending calls and multitasking is super intuitive and with macOS Big Sur the whole system is snappy. It’s so good, that I almost never shut it down, it instantly wakes up from sleep and I’m ready to get going!Really there are only some minor inconveniences here: There are only two Thunderbolt ports and a headphone jack. That is a limitation at times.It’s a bit heavy at 1.4kg but if most of your work is mostly desk orientated, then it shouldn’t be a problem.Another “issue” is the app compatibility thing with M1. Since these Macs are now ARM based and not x64 like their Intel counterparts, you may run into some silly stuff occasionally. But that’s part of the process. I’d suggest you check in advance if your favorite and essential apps are working with these Silicon macs.Overall, anyone looking to upgrade their experience to a whole new level, look no further!I have been loving this machine so much that I doubt that I’m ever returning back to Windows!",

          "reviewDescription": "I bought a 512 GB / 8 GB MAC model (Space Grey) Macbook Pro M1. Great product, faster than many MAC models. Front camera though looks blurry in medium/low light and that is a total disappointment when you are spending a huge amount on Apple devices. It is so blurry even your 2013 Mac model would look better in front of it. Battery life though is really good and Apple's tall claims of 20 hours of battery life are pretty much good. The only problem is they are using a simulator Rosetta for lot of applications which may or may not be simulating it perfectly. I haven't found a problem as of now but read a lot of reviews on YouTube. Not tested the gaming environment for now, so no comments on that. I would recommend to wait for some new MAC model with improvements to the M1 chip.Also, I recently bought this and I'm pretty new to exploring the MAC environment myself, Amazon did put a price drop on this within a week and now they do not agree to match the price. Really sad when you buy products like these and the price drop and they are not ready to match it, instead they suggest to place another order and return the existing order which I think is downright insane.Overall product is fine though, if not for Amazon sucky price match policy. Disappointed with Amazon though on this part.",

I have the 512gb SSD 8gb RAM configuration.Battery: It sips battery life and I can easily last a day of extensive graphic designing and editing and a few hours worth of calls and still have a little below 50% left!Ecosystem: I already had an iPhone and an iPad and getting another Apple device just adds into the ecosystem. I can receive calls, transfer documents and carry over my work from one device to another!Performance: This MBP boasts power. Most apps open instantly from Chrome to Adobe Premiere Pro and it handles tasks like a beast! It has a gorgeous display perfect for color accurate work and has loud, extremely good speakers. Attending calls and multitasking is super intuitive and with macOS Big Sur the whole system is snappy. It’s so good, that I almost never shut it down, it instantly wakes up from sleep and I’m ready to get going!Really there are only some minor inconveniences here: There are only two Thunderbolt ports and a headphone jack. That is a limitation at times.It’s a bit heavy at 1.4kg but if most of your work is mostly desk orientated, then it shouldn’t be a problem.Another “issue” is the app compatibility thing with M1. Since these Macs are now ARM based and not x64 like their Intel counterparts, you may run into some silly stuff occasionally. But that’s part of the process. I’d suggest you check in advance if your favorite and essential apps are working with these Silicon macs.Overall, anyone looking to upgrade their experience to a whole new level, look no further!I have been loving this machine so much that I doubt that I’m ever returning back to Windows!",

The thermal performance is way better than the intel chips based MacBook pros , despite playing Graphics intensive games (Asphalt 9) while copying files from an external hard drive , still didn’t trigger the fans to go high speed … so far a great experience. Only wish it came in 16\" screen size",

          "reviewTitle": "Great product. However, wait for newer versions of M1",
          "reviewDescription": "I bought a 512 GB / 8 GB MAC model (Space Grey) Macbook Pro M1. Great product, faster than many MAC models. Front camera though looks blurry in medium/low light and that is a total disappointment when you are spending a huge amount on Apple devices. It is so blurry even your 2013 Mac model would look better in front of it. Battery life though is really good and Apple's tall claims of 20 hours of battery life are pretty much good. The only problem is they are using a simulator Rosetta for lot of applications which may or may not be simulating it perfectly. I haven't found a problem as of now but read a lot of reviews on YouTube. Not tested the gaming environment for now, so no comments on that. I would recommend to wait for some new MAC model with improvements to the M1 chip.Also, I recently bought this and I'm pretty new to exploring the MAC environment myself, Amazon did put a price drop on this within a week and now they do not agree to match the price. Really sad when you buy products like these and the price drop and they are not ready to match it, instead they suggest to place another order and return the existing order which I think is downright insane.Overall product is fine though, if not for Amazon sucky price match policy. Disappointed with Amazon though on this part.",

          "reviewDescription": "Battery life : not able to kill it in a day even after intensive work ( including editing in final cut pro )Thickness: weight management is perfect, not at all bulky. Its a very powerful and light machineRam management:Just perfect. 8gb is sufficient. I am able to open around 60 to 90 tabs in safari plus final cut pro plus Microsoft word, excel and using side car with ipad all at once and not even a single lag or drop its butter smooth.Performance in editing:Editing 8k videos HDR content in final cut pro. Butter smooth editing experience even in best quality mode.Only render time suffers during exporting HDR 4k video file.If you are exporting no HDR file then rendering and exporting is hyper fast.So M1 chip is really making everything seems so fluid and fast.Comparison with other laptops:This laptop has spoiled me.I tried to go back to windows for a work but made me realise as if i am using some old machine from past. ( windows laptop that i was using was also launched this year with latest specifications)Final conclusion:If you do lots of editingGo for Pro model if your budget allowsDont stretch your budget if you can afford macbook air M1Only if you need consistent high performance for prolonged period then buy this pro model else go with macbook air modelBoth are equally powerful.Cons:Less portsThats it.",
